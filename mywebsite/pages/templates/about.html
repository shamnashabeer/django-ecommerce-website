            Well-known by the popular sobriquet ‘milma’, Kerala Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (KCMMF) was formed in 1980 as a state adjunct of the National Dairy Programme ‘Operation Flood’. It is a three-tiered organization.  A enriched milk and various milk-based products as well as mango drink throughout the state. MILMA has been instrumental in achieving the national goal of self-sufficiency in milk production in the state.The goal of KCMMF is "The socio-economic progress of the dairy farmer through procuring, processing and marketing of milk". Still the goal is receding as Kerala enjoys one of the highest ranges of per capita milk consumption. KCMMF is totally content in the realization of this vision which was set before it. KCMMF has achieved the distinction in its performance by close association and bond with National Dairy Development Board, Animal Husbandry Department and Dairy Development Department of the State and Kerala Livestock Development Board.
